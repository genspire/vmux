# vmux
a tmux + vim setup for development 

I have added vim-slime to allow for the incremental development of an Apache Spark job. 

## To Install
clone the repo and run the install script:

```
git clone git@github.com:genspire/vmux.git &&  \
cd vmux && ./install.sh
```

It is assumed that ~/bin exists and is on the path
